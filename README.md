# Password Generator 
This project was designated as an assignment for MSU's coding bootcamp.
The Javascrip file was modified to meet the acceptance criteria.

#Purpose
When the user clicks the button to generate a password. They are presented with a series of criteria:
- A value must be presented.
- The password must have at least 8 characters or no more than 128 characters.
- The client must confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric and/or special character (at least one must be selected.)

When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria. The password is diplayed on the page.
